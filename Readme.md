# App Display Page

This is a simple PHP script that you can 
modify and insert your iOS's applicaiton id.
It will spit out some basic HTML that you can
then apply your own styling to.

# Why?

I wanted to make sure that I had accurate
descriptions and current pricing information
for all my apps wherever I display this data
on my personal websites. This was the natural
thing to do.
